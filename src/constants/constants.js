    title: 'Bad Bank Three-Tier',
    description: `"Bad Bank" is my MIT capstone application with a front-end, back-end, and database. The Bad Bank name refers to the project's earlier iteration where it was a banking application that was not secure (i.e. no login, no administrative privileges). However, we will be using firebase authentication and authorization to create different levels of authorization to turn "Bad Bank" into a more secure bank - a lot like what a really company might use. This project was created in my effort to learn how to build a complete 3-tier application and it will continue to grow as my knowledge of application development grows. It is also designed to be an easy way to show off things I've learned in my Master's Full Stack Development program.`,
